I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Connecticut. My advisor is [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). I got my M.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).

My primary research interests are in deep learning, machine learning and pattern recognition using large-scale datasets, with an emphasis on healthcare informatics, online social networks, cheminformatics and bioinformatics. 

Experience

### Research Assistant | University of Connecticut  
10/2017 - Present
 * Designed deep learning, machine learning methods to improve drug discovery & precision medicine. 
 * Constructed the graph convolutional networks on graphs for node embedding and graph embedding.
 * Created various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) models on domain mappings, missing imputation, etc.
 * Developed multi-view and multi-task algorithms that automatically detect disorder problems using daily living datasets.
 * Explored contextual embedding of medical concepts from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with Word2vec.

### Co-Investigator | Yale Center for Molecular Discovery, Yale University  
10/2018 - Present
 * Designed prominent machine learning methods, especially deep learning, for the early stage of drug design.
 * Designed the molecular graph convolutional networks for learning molecular representations from undirected graphs.
 * Built standard database for protein-drug interactions,
