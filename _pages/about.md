I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Connecticut. My advisor is [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). I was supervised by [Prof. Fei Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/feiwang03/) and had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna](http://halcyon.usc.edu/~pk/prasannawebsite/). Before I came here, I got my M.S. degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I have spent some time interning in University of Southern California (2014) and Chinese Academic of Science (2015).

My primary research interests are in deep learning, machine learning and pattern recognition using large-scale datasets, with an emphasis on healthcare informatics, online social networks and bioinformatics.
